# E-commerce REST API

An E-commerce REST API utilizing JavaScript, Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

This project is part of my portfolio for completing the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Career Path.

## Running the app

To run locally, `npm install`, then `npm run start`.

This repo includes an `example.env` file that contains important environment variables for reference.  
Make sure to create a `.env` file and include all variables found in the `example.env` file, replacing the example values with those specific to your environment/needs.  
Uses [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/) to load the `.env` file.

Once the app is running locally, you can access the API at `http://localhost:<your-port>`.

Currently the application only contains a single route for `/` stating that the API Server is not yet implemented.
